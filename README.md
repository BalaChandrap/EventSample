This is a sample Dapp which can fetch events from a contract.

Before this app, please check the dapp_metamask to get a hang on how to interact with contracts using web3.js.

Steps for Interacting with a contract:

1. Include web3.js in your app.
2. Createa a new web3 provider and assing the provider (basically to which ethereum node you are connecting to)
3. Create a contract object using ABI.
4. Get the deployed instance of that contract object.
5. Call the events or methods uisng the contract instance.
